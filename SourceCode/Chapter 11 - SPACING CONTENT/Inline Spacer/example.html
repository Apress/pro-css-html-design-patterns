<h1>Inline Spacer</h1>

<p>Just like you can use <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> to insert vertical space 
   into content, <br />  you can use an inline spacer to insert and control 
   horizontal space.
   <span class="space" > </span>The inline spacer is a marker element 
   that emphasizes the space in between content.
   <span class="space" > </span>You use it when you do <em>not</em> want to  
   mark up <em>content</em>, but you still want to control the amount of space 
   in between content.</p>

<p>For example, if your page design requires extra space before sentences, 
   it is not a good idea to mark up sentences, because that would prevent you from
   cutting across sentence boundaries with additional markup. 
   <span class="space" > </span>Marking up the first word of a sentence would not 
   be semantically accurate because the extra space separates sentences not words.
   <span class="space" > </span>The inline spacer solves this problem 
   because it does not interfere with other markup. 
   <span class="space" > </span>It is also semantically correct 
   because its purpose is to mark up and emphasize space.</p>
