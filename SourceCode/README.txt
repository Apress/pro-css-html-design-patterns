README FILE FOR THE SOURCE CODE
Pro CSS and HTML Design Patterns 

The source code zip file contains all the source code in the book. You can unzip 
it to any directory. When unzipped, the source code is organized in folders 
by chapter and design pattern. There is a separate folder for each chapter. 
In turn, each chapter folder contains example folders named after the 
design patterns presented in the chapter.

Each example folder contains the following files:
 - example.html is the HTML document for the example.
 - page.css contains the CSS used in the example.
 - site.css contains trivial CSS that is common to all examples. 
 - ie6.css (when present) contains special CSS exclusively for Internet Explorer 6.
 - ie7.css (when present) contains special CSS exclusively for Internet Explorer 7.

In addition, each chapter folder contains a file named index.html, which contains 
links to each example in each chapter. This makes it quick and easy to find any 
example in the book and preview it in browsers.

The folder named JavaScript Library v0.24 contains the Source code and licenses 
for the JavaScript Libraries used in the book.

Have fun playing with the examples...
